# OSU AI Bootcamp - Module 19 Challenge - Neural Networking 2
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
The premise of this chalenge was that I am tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so I have been asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.
